Wolpertinger-DDPG for MountainCar-v0
This repository provides an implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm enhanced with the Wolpertinger architecture to solve the MountainCar-v0 environment from OpenAI Gymnasium.

ðŸ§  Overview
This project demonstrates how DDPGâ€”a model-free, actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithmâ€”can be adapted for discrete action spaces using the Wolpertinger architecture. The MountainCar-v0 task, a classic control benchmark, serves as the testbed for this approach.
